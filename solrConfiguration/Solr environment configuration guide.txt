*****	Solr environment configuration guide	*****
*****************************************************

In this configuration guide I am assuming that you are using a Linux based operating system, if you need to configure the environment on a different operating system or if you need to build a more complex Solr environment please refer to the Solr and Tomcat online guides.


Assuming that your username is "myUser" :

1) copy the following folders
		
apache-tomcat-7.0.57
solrHome_4.10.4

from solrConfiguration directory to your home ( /home/myUser )

2) Open in a text editor the following file

/home/myUser/apache-tomcat-7.0.57/webapps/solr/WEB-INF/web.xml

and customize the solr/home parameter, in our case the following block of xml:

<env-entry>
    <env-entry-name>solr/home</env-entry-name>
    <env-entry-value>/home/summa/solrHome_4.10.4</env-entry-value>
	<env-entry-type>java.lang.String</env-entry-type>
</env-entry>

will be changed into this block:

<env-entry>
	<env-entry-name>solr/home</env-entry-name>
    <env-entry-value>/home/myUser/solrHome_4.10.4</env-entry-value>
    <env-entry-type>java.lang.String</env-entry-type>
</env-entry>

3) Solr is a web application, so in order to be launched you first need to launch its container.
In particular I used Tomcat, so you have to start Tomcat by :
opening a terminal
go into the /home/myUser/apache-tomcat-7.0.57/bin directory
type and execute the command "./startup.sh"

4) Open a web browser and go to the following address :
http://localhost:8080/solr
You should see the Solr homepage (if not wait for a few seconds and reload the page)

5) Select the core called "collection1" from the core selector combobox
just under that selector click on the "Query" link
click on the "Execute Query" button in the right part of the screen (you are asking Solr to show you all the documents contained in collection1)
the number of documents retrieved will be 0

6) repeat the instructions at the point 5 after loading the CSV file in Solr to verify that everything went well

7) If you want to delete the documents just uploaded you can open a new tab in your browser, paste the following url in the address bar and press enter :

localhost:8080/solr/collection1/update?stream.body=<delete><query>*:*</query></delete>&commit=true

8) If you want to "close" Solr you just need to type and execute the command "./shutdown.sh" in the same terminal that you used to start Tomcat (see point 3).
